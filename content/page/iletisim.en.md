Thank you dear Ged [^1] for inspiring me to create a web page that is not unnecessarily large, does not bother users with additional components and a long load time. This club supports the internet and protecting users from unnecessarily large sites.

This site was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and with the theme [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/). Also, this site is a Green Member of [512kbClub](https://512kb.club/) with its size below 100kb.

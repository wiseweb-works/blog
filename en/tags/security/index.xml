<p>Today, we will make an in-depth review of OpenVPN, one of the most important software of recent times, in my opinion. In this review, we will first talk about what OpenVPN is used for. Then we will examine what we need to run the program and what needs to be done before the first run. Finally, I will try to explain what goes on in the background from the first moment the connection is started to the last step when the data is decrypted. Therefore, I guess our article will consist of 3 parts and a question-answer section if necessary. Now let&rsquo;s buckle up and take a trip to the deep and gloomy world of the internet.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-openvpn-and-what-is-it-used-for">What is OpenVPN and what is it used for?</h2>
<p>Today, there is almost no business that cannot be done online. Even our work, which is not normally online, has evolved to work from home due to the pandemic and the new normal. However, there were big problems both because it is a working method that we are not used to and because our people are not very good with technology. Before it became clear that people needed to connect from their home computers to their office computers, some companies came up with frivolous ideas such as sending office computers to employees&rsquo; homes. They understood very well how wrong this was from the feedback they received in a short time. In short, it was finally accepted that electronic devices should remain in the office and somehow a secure and sustainable connection should be made remotely. Of course, institutions found themselves in such needs before, but such a large-scale situation was not in question back then. Before the pandemic, it used various protocols such as PPTP, L2TP, IPSec, IKev2, SSTP and finally OpenVPN. These are usually abbreviations for certain long and fancy words and their basic logic is to connect two or more devices and make them act as if they are on the same network. I won&rsquo;t talk much, as protocols prior to OpenVPN brought with them certain weaknesses, slowness, and technical difficulties with its implementation. OpenVPN is the name of the protocol and program that allows at least 2 devices in the role of server and client to connect to each other and do this in a way that meets industry standards. I&rsquo;m using a remote desktop program, I seem to hear you say what is the need for this. Unfortunately, he and all other programs like him basically have to use this protocol. If you press the shield icon or the connection details in TeamViewer, one of the most famous, you can see the OpenVPN protocol.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-need-to-establish-an-openvpn-connection">What do we need to establish an OpenVPN connection?</h2>
<p>First of all, OpenVPN must be installed on both the server and client (the device to be connected) side. Then, a settings (config) file should be edited that shows the conditions under which the devices will communicate. The main event is that this config file is generated and used by the client. This config file is divided into server_config used by the server and client_config used by the client.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-establishing-an-openvpn-connection">What happens when establishing an OpenVPN connection?</h2>
<p>Every time I connect with OpenVPN I feel like R2-D2 hijacking their Starfleet plans. People don&rsquo;t always want to find themselves in deep scrutiny and may ask someone to explain to them what and how. In my purpose of writing this article, I actually asked myself this question and I put a lot of effort to get the answer. I don&rsquo;t want you to work so hard, but I can&rsquo;t say that you should upload it immediately, don&rsquo;t think about the rest, it&rsquo;s my job. As I promised at the beginning, I will explain this process to you in depth and leave the decision to you. Here&rsquo;s how the process works in an OpenVPN connection, pros and cons (as I&rsquo;ve been able to figure it out so far). You first establish a TCP/UDP connection. You run a process like any application that uses TCP, and then you switch to the TLS layer. You are doing handshake and some authentication at TLS layer. This layer is also called the control channel. Then a certain communication is fixed and the data channel is passed. The process of encrypting and decrypting the data packets to be sent this time in the data or data channel begins. For this, devices are talking to each other and data is started to be sent under certain common conditions. In short, at the end of the process I have described in this way, the communication we started from 0 ends with the safe and desired data access to us, or requests are sent again, this time in a reverse way, over the connection that is kept open. Thus, a system like nested pipes emerges. If you need to write the only important thing required for the article here:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be <code>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384_P512</code>.
<ul>
<li>Here the <code>TLS</code> input specifies that the control channel will be executed over the TLS layer. Other alternatives are <code>SSL</code> or <code>NULL</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>ECDHE</code> input specifies that the first pre-key will be generated using the Elliptic Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Other alternatives are to use <code>DHE</code>, <code>DH</code> or not.</li>
<li>The <code>ECDSA</code> data indicates that the Elliptic Digital Signature Certificate Algorithm will be used for mutual authentication and asymmetric key. Another available alternative is <code>RSA</code>. No need to count the others.</li>
<li>Specifies the encryption algorithm to be used on the <code>AES_256_GCM</code> data channel. Other alternatives are <code>AES-128-CBC</code>, <code>AES-128-GCM</code> and <code>AES-256-CBC</code></li>
<li><code>SHA384</code> specifies the hash algorithm to use. The other alternative is <code>SHA256</code>.</li>
<li><code>P512</code> allows the elliptic curve to be used to be selected as Prime-512. Other alternatives are <code>P-256</code> and <code>P-384</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-process-of-establishing-the-tcp-connection">The process of establishing the TCP connection</h3>
<p>Now, if you have an approximate picture of the process in your mind, I start with the explanation of the TCP process. Let&rsquo;s say we have a client and a server in our case, and the connection is just these two. The client sends a SYN (m) packet to the server it wants to connect to. In response, the server sends a SYN (n) packet and an ACK (m+1) packet over the same port. The client that receives this also returns as ACK (n+1) in response, and a 3-way TCP handshake or 3-Way TCP handshake takes place. Thus, we have an open channel between client and server over the specified port.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the photos, if the process runs smoothly, communication can be made in 3 steps. But if you ask why we are doing this in 3 steps, can&rsquo;t it be done in a shorter way? I would say (for now) no, no, for a full-duplex communication, both parties need to send SYN and ACK packets. Maybe I&rsquo;ll tell you different ways in the future, but for now this is how it is. Anyway, the TCP/UDP part is always short and simple.</p>
<h3 id="process-running-in-tls-layer">Process running in TLS layer</h3>
<p>After establishing a communication over TCP, the client is the person who takes the conversation to another level. Clients always request something from the server or request an answer. In general, servers are not seen to respond to a request that did not come to them. The process proceeds according to the principle of demand first, then supply. Yes, the parties are at the TLS layer now. The client first says hello to the server. Not a joke, it&rsquo;s real. The first packet sent by the client is called the <code>Client-Hello</code> packet. Next to this package (in order to speed up the process), the <code>Supported-Chipers</code> package that specifies the encryption algorithms it supports, a randomly generated number by the client, an <code>SNI</code> server name indicator if more than one service is running on the same IP address, and the session ID if necessary. . The server&rsquo;s response to this is, first of all, a polite hello. Because the first packet that the server sends in response is called the <code>Server-Hello</code> packet. Next to this package, the <code>Selected-Chiper</code> package, which specifies the server certificate, the encryption algorithms it supports, and the algorithm it chooses, sends a random number it generates, the Session ID if necessary, and an SNI-like ID if more than one client is connecting over the same IP. . The client first verifies with the server certificate whether it is really the person it is waiting for by starting the communication. In addition, in some cases, the server verifies with a certificate whether the client is one of the clients it expects. If this mutual-authentication process is positive, the next stage is passed. The key generation and exchange process is triggered. At this stage, the client again steps in and says that he wants to change the key with the algorithm they have determined during this communication, which is considered insecure. Parties begin to generate a prekey with Diffie-Hellman or ECDHE. For this, pre-secrets are shared by the client and server. The answers found by performing a number of mathematical operations are sent to the top and the same result is reached by performing mathematical operations again. The result is the first fore-key they&rsquo;ve securely created between them. After that, with the encryption algorithm they determined,
A data channel other than the control channel is created to communicate and the process continues from there.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the photos, the process is almost the same as when connecting to a web page. Only certain stages are added, removed or changed according to needs. For example, in accordance with PFS, which stands for Advanced Privacy, the parties do not transmit the front-key with the server&rsquo;s asymmetric key. Because in this case, since the same key will be used for each session, the data will be stored and then the data will be readable retrospectively by waiting for a day when the key is revealed. That&rsquo;s why this change was made. Again, in accordance with the zero trust threat model, I want each layer and process to advance the process without trusting the other to do their job correctly. That&rsquo;s why we want the packets to be encrypted according to the <code>tls-auth</code> feature and to verify the integrity of the incoming and outgoing data, even at that first communication moment in the TLS layer. From the first moment you say hello, third parties will not be able to understand what you are talking about and at what stage you are. For this, the first communication is started with a predetermined key(s) and if necessary, these keys are renewed at regular intervals. Thus, even until the first pre-key is created in the TLS layer, confidentiality is not compromised and unauthorized parties are not created in vain.</p>
<h3 id="process-running-in-the-data-layer">Process running in the data layer</h3>
<p>If this whole process has been completed successfully and the data channel has been passed, you have now come to the best part of the job. Data will be encrypted with AES encryption method. During encryption, the tables will be shuffled according to the CBC-GCM counter mode according to your selection, and a 128 or 256-bit encryption key will be used in this process according to your selection. Of course, whatever you choose, the encryption block length will be 128 bits. Only the encryption key length changes. AES-256-GCM that I have chosen for this explanation is an AEAD encryption type. It summarizes the data it sends independently from other channels and processes at a certain stage and sends it together with the summary. Thus, authentication and encryption functions are fulfilled in AEAD, which stands for &lsquo;Authentication Encryption with associated data&rsquo;. There is a problem that requires a distinction to be made here. At what stage and in which order will we use the encryption and hashing algorithms?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>According to EtM, which is the first approach, the data is first encrypted, then encrypted with another key as a result of the digest, and the resulting result is sent together in blocks. If we look at real-world solutions that use it, the IPSec protocol will come to mind first. This is the only method that can achieve the highest security definition in AE, but this can only be achieved if the MAC algorithm used is free of corruption or has not yet been cracked. Various EtM cipher suites are also available for SSHv2. Note, however, that key separation is mandatory for data and digest (different keys must be used for encryption and key hashing), otherwise you may end up with a potentially insecure result depending on the particular encryption method and hash function used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the second approach, E&amp;M, plain text data is encrypted and a summary of the encryption state of the plain text data is added next to it. Although only one key is used here, the fact that there are two different results (encryption result and digest result) for the same data clearly shows that the security is not good enough. As a real-world solution using this system, we can cite the first versions of SSH as an example. In order to improve this, methods such as encrypting the sent summary file with the same key were tried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to MtE, which is the third and last approach that I know of, a summary file is generated based on plain text. Then the plaintext and digest file together are encrypted with the key. The ciphertext and ciphertext file are sent together. If we look at real world solutions that use it, first and foremost are SSL/TLS implementations. We all know how reliable and sustainable SSL/TLS applications are in themselves. Beyond that, improvements such as <code>MAC-then-pad-then-encrypt</code> have been made over the years to increase security. According to this improvement, first the plain text is digested, then filled up to the block size, and then the encryption is done. This results in an even more reliable encryption result. But there are cases where the padding mechanism causes attacks like Padding Oracle if it makes certain mistakes.</p>

<p>After selecting the AEAD approach to be used, the path shown in the graphic above is followed according to the use of TAP or TUN. According to this path, the action done/desired to be done in the user area goes to TAP/TUN adapters at the kernel level. Because these adapters are at the kernel level, they operate very quickly. Then the virtual adapters do the necessary encryption with the relevant library, add the digest if necessary, and set the packet size. Then the server sends packets sequentially to the client&rsquo;s Ethernet interface over the Ethernet interface. The client that receives it reconfigures the packages, organizes them, combines them if necessary, and decrypts them with the necessary libraries. After decrypting it, it transmits the client to the end user via the virtual adapter. Thus, as a result of all these mathematical operations and efforts, after a few cycles, the user reached the desired content. It is quite long to explain, but very easy to use, dear readers. You just have to visit the relevant <a href="https://github.com/wiseweb-works/openvpn-most-secure-install/">script page</a> on my GitHub page. The related script makes all these adjustments interactively for you. All you have to do is sit back and enjoy.</p>

<p>Today we will learn how to generate SSL certificates to ensure that the traffic between a website or application server you manage and your visitors is confidential / reliable and verifiable. In my previous articles, I explained how and with what configuration you would deploy the certificate you produced. In this article, I will show you how to set up the equation of less bread, more meatballs, that is, how to produce a faster and more secure SSL certificate. Normally, if you are familiar with Let&rsquo;s Encrypt&rsquo;s ACME protocol (as of the date of writing), it is possible to generate a 1024-4098 (if you try too hard, maybe 8196) bit certificate with RSA asymmetric key structure and use it for 90 days relatively. However, generating such a large key, using it during TLS handshake after generating it, and being compatible with the devices used by the visitors causes problems in most scenarios. For example, when 4096 bits are used instead of 2048 bits, I am faced with 0.4-0.8 seconds longer handshake times in some of my attempts. As if it&rsquo;s okay for the handshake to take that long, it puts an extra load on the server. But when you generate a 384-bit ECC certificate instead of 4096-bit RSA, you get a much faster certificate and at the same time security equal to 7680-bit RSA (if it were that size).</p>
<p>Well, you explained it well, but where is the point of this work, I seem to hear you say. I will upset you, but there is no point in this business. The reason why it doesn&rsquo;t is hidden in the background math. Briefly, I will talk about the minor differences in the production and use of both certificates, explain how and why they cause big differences, and in the last part, I will talk about something that is not written in the title as a bonus. (For the bonus you&rsquo;ll have to read till the end :D)</p>

<h2 id="production-process-of-ecc-certificate">Production process of ECC Certificate</h2>
<p>First of all (as always), we need to install the latest updates via the console with the package manager of the Linux version we are in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Ubuntu: sudo apt update <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> sudo apt upgrade -y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Fedora: sudo yum update -y
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Arch Linux: sudo pacman -Syyu
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After the updates are installed, we start configuring the nginx service (which is the service that allows you to receive external HTTP/HTTPS connections) on your server (Ubuntu in my case). First of all, it should be noted that because of the confusion, apache, nginx and litespeed services are different services that do the same job. I chose NGINX because it is easier to manage and has more community support.</p>
<h2 id="lets-generate-the-private-key">Let&rsquo;s generate the private key</h2>
<p>First, we generate the private key with OpenSSL. The OpenSSL command we will use is &rsquo;ecparam&rsquo; (EC parameter manipulation) and to pass the configuration parameters to this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp384r1 -out privkey.pem
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>The <code>-genkey</code> option tells OpenSSL to generate an EC key.</li>
<li>The <code>-name</code> parameter tells OpenSSL which curve to use.</li>
<li>The <code>-out</code> parameter tells OpenSSL to write the output to a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that OpenSSL writes its output in PEM format by default. We can check that OpenSSL is doing the right thing with the <code>ec</code> command that handles EC keys:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl ec -in privkey.pem -noout -text
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>-in</code> is input file</li>
<li>The <code>-noout</code> tells OpenSSL not to extract the key, meaninglessly printing privkey.pem to stdout.</li>
<li><code>-text</code> tells OpenSSL to write information about the key in plain text format</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well and the key is generated correctly, OpenSSL will show something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>read EC key
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Private-Key: (384 bit)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>priv:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    [secret]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>pub:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    [secret]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>ASN1 OID: secp384r1
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NIST CURVE: P-384
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This verifies that the key was created with the P-384 curve. If you ask why we don&rsquo;t use P-512 instead of P-384, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt doesn&rsquo;t sign if the ecliptic curves are higher than 384 bits, and modern browsers like Google Chrome mark websites using 512-bit ecliptic curves as invalid. That&rsquo;s the short answer.</p>
<h2 id="lets-create-openssl-configuration-for-the-certificate">Let&rsquo;s create OpenSSL configuration for the certificate</h2>
<p>Now we need to create an OpenSSL configuration file containing the domain-specific parameters for which we want to get the TLS certificate. In this example, we will enter the following configuration in an <code>openssl.cnf</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>[ req ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>prompt = no
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>encrypt_key = no
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>default_md = sha512
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>distinguished_name = dname
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>req_extensions = reqext
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>[ dname ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>CN = example.com
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>emailAddress = admin@example.com
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>[ reqext ]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>subjectAltName = DNS:example.com, DNS:www.example.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here is a brief description of these configuration options:</p>
<p>In the required <code>[ req ]</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>prompt=no</code> tells OpenSSL to get as much configuration as possible from the config file</li>
<li><code>encrypt_key = no</code> tells OpenSSL not to encrypt the private key with a password. (Encrypted private keys are supported by Nginx, but I don&rsquo;t use them.)</li>
<li><code>default_md=sha512</code> tells OpenSSL to sign the CSR with SHA512. (As far as I know, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt only supports RSA with SHA256 for its signatures, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we can&rsquo;t use stronger encryption in CSR.)</li>
<li><code>distinguished_name=dname</code> tells OpenSSL to look for a <code>[ dname ]</code> section for Distinguished Name configuration options.</li>
<li><code>req_extensions=reqext</code> tells OpenSSL to look for a <code>[ reqext ]</code> section in the configuration options for Subject Alternative Names (SANs) extensions that it wants to configure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Distinguished Name <code>[ dname ]</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CN = example.com</code> indicates the Common Name of the certificate.</li>
<li>Your <code>emailAddress = admin@example.com</code> email address must be prominent.
Desired Extensions In the <code>[ reqext ]</code> section, subjectAltName provides the list of SANs for the certificate. (Chrome as of v58 requires that the Common Name be included in the list of SANs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt v2 supports wildcard domains, so in this example you can use a single-level wildcard for non-apex hosts (*.example.com).</p>
<h2 id="lets-create-certificate-signing-request">Let&rsquo;s Create Certificate Signing Request</h2>
<p>The final step on the client side is to generate the Certificate Signing Request using OpenSSL, then we will forward it to Let&rsquo;s Encrypt for signing and retrieve the signed certificate.</p>
<p>The OpenSSL command required to generate a CSR is <code>req</code> .</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl req -new -config openssl.cnf -key privkey.pem -out csr.pem
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>-new</code> tells OpenSSL that we have created a CSR (and we do not examine an existing CSR)</li>
<li><code>-config</code> openssl.cnf specifies the config file we created above</li>
<li><code>-key privkey.pem</code> indicates the private key we created above</li>
<li><code>-out csr.pem</code> tells OpenSSL to write the CSR to an output file (instead of stdout)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can verify that we have generated the CSR correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl req -in csr.pem -noout -text -verify
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>-verify</code> asks OpenSSL to verify the signature in the CSR</li>
</ul>
<p>This should produce the following expected results in the output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>verify OK

</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="ask-lets-encrypt-to-sign-our-certificate">Ask Let&rsquo;s Encrypt to sign our certificate</h2>
<p>The final step is to send the CSR with an ACME client to Let&rsquo;s Encrypt for signing, <code>certbot</code> is the most common client for this job.</p>
<p>Command line options passed to the <code>Certbot</code> client depend on our setup, the person our domain is registered to, etc. varies depending. Usually we need to use the <code>certonly</code> command and if you used asterisks (*) you need to use one of the certbot DNS plugins.</p>
<p>For example, if the domain <code>example.com</code> is registered with Cloudflare, we can use the corresponding plugin to handle the verification, which is extremely convenient and does not require manual intervention in the process. (Configuring the Cloudflare plugin with secret token information is beyond the scope of this article.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s usually recommended to make sure everything is ok with <code>--dry-run</code> first to make sure everything is ok.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>certbot nginx certonly --dry-run --domain <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;example.com&#34;</span> --domain <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;www.example.com&#34;</span> --csr csr.pem
</span></span></code></pre></div><ul>
<li>Quotation marks are required around characters to avoid erroneous manipulations and are generally a good idea.</li>
<li><code>--csr csr.pem</code> tells certbot that we already have a certificate and we need Let&rsquo;s Encrypt to sign it for us.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Certbot client will check on the command line that the requested list of domains matches the domains listed in the certificate and will use the Certbot NGINX plugin to verify that the domain is ours and let us know if there are any issues.</p>
<p>If nothing is wrong, it will tell you:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>IMPORTANT NOTES:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> - The dry run was successful.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The actual command is just as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>certbot nginx certonly --domain <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;example.com&#34;</span> --domain <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;www.example.com&#34;</span> --csr csr.pem
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After a (long) delay, the client will output:</p>
<ol>
<li>Signed certificate: <code>0000_cert.pem</code></li>
<li>Root and intermediate certificates: <code>0000_chain.pem</code></li>
<li>Certificate + intermediates: <code>0001_chain.pem</code>
At this point, the CSR <code>csr.pem</code> can be deleted.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we are curious, we can inspect the certificates returned by the client with OpenSSL using the <code>x509</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>openssl x509 -in 0001_chain.pem -noout -text
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, we will discover that as described above, Let&rsquo;s Encrypt signs our certificate with a SHA256 signature. (As well as being more secure, SHA512 outperforms SHA256 on modern 64-bit CPUs.) But our public key should still use ECDSA.</p>
<p>These files are not ordinary, so we must move and edit them in a more informative way.</p>
<p>On Debian Linux I like to create subdirectories for my domains by keeping my private key in <code>/home/USER_NAME/SSL/private/example.com/privkey.pem</code> and certificates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/home/USER_NAME/SSL/certs/example.com/cert.pem</code></li>
<li><code>/home/USER_NAME/SSL/certs/example.com/chain.pem</code></li>
<li><code>/home/USER_NAME/SSL/certs/example.com/fullchain.pem</code></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="end">END</h1>
<p>If we&rsquo;ve done everything right, inspecting the certificate with a web browser like Chrome will confirm that it&rsquo;s an EC certificate:</p>

<p>Today, if you are serving a website and/or App on your current server, I will talk about the SSL connection you need and the openssl library in connection with it. SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are a form of connection that allows people who want to connect to your server to communicate securely with your site. There are versions ranging from SSL v1-v3 in the past, and while sites generally use these SSL versions, SSL has now been abandoned by the sites and has been replaced by the more secure TLS. However, we will still need to use the word &ldquo;ssl&rdquo; in the narrative part and while editing the config files. To tell you this with a little humor, have you ever thought why when you want to download the 64 bit version of an application, why it is called &ldquo;amd_64&rdquo;? Because AMD was the first to switch to 64 bit, this naming remained as amd_64 as a sign of respect and/or habit. Likewise, although we are currently using TLS, the naming and configuration parameters remain &ldquo;SSL&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As in our previous article, I will explain the process again under three different headings as simple, recommended and advanced. Title contents are gradually considered according to personal requirements. Although the titles are linked to each other, leaving them at a desired stage will not pose a problem.</p>
<h2 id="simple-configuration">Simple configuration</h2>

<p>In addition to the previous settings, we will make some performance improvements, as well as some additional configurations that will enable your site to rank higher in SSL test sites. After that, we will make some improvements to ensure that some headers and resources of your site are not exploited by third party sites, which will be beneficial for your site&rsquo;s user access.</p>

<p>First, we&rsquo;ll add a header to your site to indicate that it should only be connected via ssl. In this way, those who have entered your site before and those who already have this title in their browser will not be able to access your site non-SSL even if they want it. Then we will staple the SSL certificates that should be used in HTTP sessions, and we will specify in advance which certificates will need to be connected next to the previous method. In this way, even if you are an authorized top certificate manager or root manager, they will not be able to connect to your site with the certificate signed on your behalf. E-Tugra Root Certificate provider residing in Turkey at the time signed a certificate to *.google.com. If you do a little research, you&rsquo;ll find out when it happened and why (how bad it could cause). Now let&rsquo;s start the final configuration part.</p>
<p>First, make sure that your site can be accessed over SSL without causing any problems. Then add one of the following headers to the nginx config file as per your request. But beware, only one.</p>

At this stage we need to extract a hash of your current certificate, hash the top signing authority&rsquo;s certificate, and continue this hashing process until we&rsquo;ve completed the entire chain, including the top root certificate authority. For this reason, we run the following commands respectively with a root user or a user with sudo authority. (The lecture was made specifically for Let&rsquo;s Encrypt.)</p>

<p>Today, I will talk about how we can keep the SSH service, which allows us to connect securely when you rent a server, more secure and away from malicious requests from outside. Foremost, I will describe the process under three different headings: simple, recommended and advanced. Title contents are gradually considered according to personal requirements. Although the titles are linked to each other, leaving them at a desired stage will not pose a problem.</p>

<p>First, we need to install the updates via the console with the package manager of the Linux version we are in.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After the updates are installed, we start configuring the SSHD service (which is the service that allows you to receive ssh connections from outside) on your server (Ubuntu in my case). Foremost, due to the confusion, it should be noted that the ssh service and the SSHD service are different services. While the SSH service is the service that connects the server to other computers or servers, the SSHD service is the service that allows other computers to connect to your server, that is, incoming connections.</p>
<p>The file that keeps the settings of the SSHD service is generally located at “/etc/ssh/sshd_config”. We need to open it with any of the text editors we use, but with a user with sudo (ie administrator) privileges.</p>

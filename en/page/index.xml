<p>Thank you dear Ged <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for inspiring me to create a web page that is not unnecessarily large, does not bother users with additional components and a long load time. This club supports the internet and protecting users from unnecessarily large sites.</p>
<p>This site was created using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and with the theme <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/">PaperMod</a>. Also, this site is a Green Member of <a href="https://512kb.club/">512kbClub</a> with its size below 100kb.</p>

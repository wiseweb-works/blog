<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://wiseweb.works)

I am a web designer, blog writer and system security volunteer, I work to make the world a better place with my friends. I believe that everyone should be able to surf the Internet in a private and secure way, without being tracked, as in 1999. The breakthrough of the previous century was the Wide Web World. The breakthrough of this century will be Wise Web Works.

Here's why:
* If you want to make the entire web smarter, you have to start by making people aware.
* While raising awareness, you can try to make the people who manage the websites wiser.
* You have the right to demand a more reliable and secure web today.

### Built With

This website is designed with components that is **fast**, reliable and cares about your privacy. The components we use are as follows.

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
* [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/)
